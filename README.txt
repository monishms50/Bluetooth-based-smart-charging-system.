This system is designed using a microcontroller, Bluetooth module, relay module, Android apps, and
Smartphone with an Android operating system. The tests are the suitability of the apps with
the Smartphone, the charging and discharging conditions on the system, and automatic
battery charging. 

In this design, it provides an automatic charging voltage and current adjustment
through the wireless message transmission of a smart charger. The smart battery
charging voltage and current can be adjusted according to different ambient
temperatures to provide a safe operation. In addition, the current battery status
and warning message can be transmitted through wireless message transmission
to a Smartphone. The user can use the application on the open platform of the
Smartphone which receives the smart battery's real-time status. If the smart
battery has an abnormal status, the abnormal status notification will be sent to
the Smartphone. Because the different batteries may have different battery
characteristics, the charging procedure needs to be in keeping with the battery
characteristics in order to set the appropriate parameters. This design also
provides for the user to set the charging parameter values.
